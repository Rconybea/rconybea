## Hello,  Roland here ðŸ‘‹
- I'm Roland Conybeare,  software developer engaged in continuous learning.
- Several decades of experience in the financial industry, working in c++ / python
- Trying to solve problems so that they "stay solved" -- though easier said than done!

## Areas of Interest
- Developer productivity.  Member of the church of emacs.  Trying to write better documentation.
- Numerical programming.  Kalman filters, PDE solvers, stochastic processes etc.
- Performance oriented programming.  For example low-latency schedulers,  some lockfree algos.
- Integration with REPL tools.  Author of various DSLs,  more recently working with pybind11.

## Currently learning about
- 2024
  - getting familiar with c++20/c++23 features;  in particular constexpr, non-type template parameters, concepts.
  - getting started with SIMD vector instructions,  in particular AVX2
  - getting started with llvm,  via Kaleidoscope tutorial.
- 2023
  - learning how to put nix to work,  in particular for projects not present in nixpkgs.
  - continuous integration using github actions.
  - custom docker containers for github CI, automagically prepared via nix.
  - diving into cmake, focusing on multi-repo builds
- 2022
  - websockets
  - pybind11
- once upon a time
  - garbage collection algorithms

## Projects
- XO: a set of cooperating c++ libraries, with python bindings, for simuation and complex event processing.
- cmake-examples: progressive series cmake examples, starting from nothing.
- docker-cpp-builder: example nix-built docker container for generic c++ builds
- docker-nix-builder: nix-built docker container with nix available at build time
