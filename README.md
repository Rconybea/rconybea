## Areas of Interest
- Developer productivity.  Member of the church of emacs.  Trying to write better documentation.
- Numerical programming.  Kalman filters, PDE solvers, stochastic processes etc.
- Performance oriented programming.  For example low-latency schedulers,  some lockfree algos.
- Integration with REPL tools.  Author of various scheme-based DSLs,  more recently working with pybind11.

## Currently learning about
- 2024
  - getting familiar with c++20/c++23 features;  in particular constexpr, non-type template parameters, concepts.
  - getting started with SIMD vector instructions,  in particular AVX2
  - getting started with llvm,  via Kaleidoscope tutorial.
  - documentation using doxygen + sphinx + breathe.
- 2023
  - in-memory B-tree
  - learning how to put nix to work,  in particular for projects not present in nixpkgs.
  - continuous integration using github actions.
  - custom docker containers for github CI, automagically prepared via nix.
  - diving into cmake, focusing on multi-repo builds
- 2022
  - xoshiro256**;  fast RNG.
  - kalman filter using Eigen for matrix algorithms.
  - websockets
  - pybind11
- once upon a time
  - garbage collection algorithms.
